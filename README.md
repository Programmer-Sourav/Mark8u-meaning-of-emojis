MarkEight Assignment..Meaning of Emojis

This app contains a few types of heart emojies... A user can check for a particular emoji and get to know the meaning of that emoji... 
Technologies used : React js, html and css... 

*** I was not able to make the reactjs app live on netlify... I tried a few times following a tutorial... I am new in web development, probably I was doing some mistake.. So, I added the live link to repl.it
